# AdventOfCode

My attempts at the AoC puzzles. I decided to do the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles in Haskell, because why not. Bear in mind that this is the first time I have ever even looked at Haskell code, so my solutions might not be the most elegant.

## Progress

During the event duration, I was able to complete all problem till and including Day 10 Part 1. I intend to pick it up again and try to complete the rest of the problems when I have more time in 2024.

## Thoughts

Haskell was very fun! This is first time I tried functional programming and can immediately see the appeal of it. At the time, there are also limitation. Doing anything stateful becomes difficult and the performance compared stuff you can write in C/C++ is just not there.

I think in the future I will use Haskell when I am working on something mathematical related to my work where the functional nature will be useful or when I am just trying to have fun. Otherwise, I will stick to my usual languages for most of my work.
